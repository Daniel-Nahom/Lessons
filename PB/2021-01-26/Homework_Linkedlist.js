/*
Homework : Linked List:


1- Create a small program that holds personal information (e.g., full name, gender, phone, address) inside a link list (each node contains a piece of personal information, e.g., full name, etc.)
2- Create a method for the program that searches for a node in a linked list based on full name and displays other information (from succeeding nodes) 
For example:

Search("Mo") - > prints "Mo, Male, 017600000, Potsdammer Platz str"
3- Create an update method that updates full name such as following:

Update(olddata, newdata)
Update("Mo","Ami"); --> this method must update a full name, so after calling this, the linked list changes to "Ami, Male, 017600000, Potsdamer Platz str"




4 - (This is optional) create a method to remove duplicated data nodes from your linked list (for a typical linked list).
For instance

If you linked list is  1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 ->4 , after calling the method, your linked list must be like :   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

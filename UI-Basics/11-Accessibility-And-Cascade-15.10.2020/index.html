    <section>
    <h2>1. Accessibility</h2>
    
    <p>A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements are used for the correct purpose at all times.</p>

    <p>Semantic elements are elements with a meaning: for example, if you need a button, use the button tag, not a div.</p>
    <p>Semantic elements (h1, h2, ..., p, table, button, ...) clearly define their content.</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Headings</h3>
    <p>
        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Alternative text in images</h3>
    <p>The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).</p>
    <img src="img/img.png" alt="Image about something (this should be a good description)">

    <h3>1.3 aria-label</h3>
    <p>When to use it? Place it in an element where a text label is not visible on the screen.</p>
    <button aria-label="Back to the page" title="Close" > X </button>

    <p>If the aria-label is one tool used by assistive technologies (like screen readers), it is not natively supported on browsers and has no effect on them. </p>

    <h2>2. Understanding the Cascade</h2>
    <h3>2.1 CSS: adjacent sibling combinator</h3>
    <div>
        <span>This is a span</span> <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p> <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <span>This is a span</span> <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p> <p>This is a paragraph</p>

    </div>
    <h3>2.2 Specificity: ID, then class, then type</h3>

    <p class="p-specificity" id="my-paragraph">This is a paragraph</p>


    <h3>2.3 Source order</h3>
    <p> In case of multiple rules with equal specificity, the last rules will be applied.</p>
    <p class="p-dynamic-style">This is a paragraph whose style is defined in two CSS files</p>

    <h3>2.4 !important is bad practice</h3>

    <p class="p-specificity" id="p-important" style="color: brown;">This is a paragraph</p>

    <h3>2.5 Avoid inline style</h3>

    <p>Inline style always wins over any rule declared in CSS files</p>

    <p class="p-specificity" style="color: brown;">This is a paragraph</p>

    <p>Bottom line: avoid using the important keyword and inline style</p>
    </section>

    <h3>2.6 More random example</h3>

    We exclude a specific element from a rule by using the :not pseudoclass
    <p class="p-to-exclude">We want this paragraph to be excluded from a CSS rule</p>
